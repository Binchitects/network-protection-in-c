### GNU Affero General Public License

**Version 3, 19 November 2007**

**Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>**

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

#### Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license designed for software and other works, ensuring cooperation within the community, especially for network server software. Unlike other licenses that restrict sharing and modification, this license guarantees your freedom to share and change all versions of a program, keeping it free for all users.

This license ensures you have access to the source code, can modify it, and can use it in new free programs. It also requires that modified versions used on network servers make their source code available to users, fostering collaboration and transparency.

#### Terms and Conditions

##### 0. Definitions

- **"This License"**: Version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
- **"The Program"**: Any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
- **"Modify"**: To copy or adapt a work in a way requiring copyright permission, creating a "modified version."
- **"Covered Work"**: The unmodified Program or a work based on it.
- **"Propagate"**: Actions that could make you liable for copyright infringement without permission.
- **"Convey"**: Propagation that enables others to make or receive copies.

##### 1. Source Code

The "source code" is the preferred form for modifications. The "Corresponding Source" includes all source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code, excluding System Libraries or general-purpose tools.

##### 2. Basic Permissions

You have unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. All rights are granted for the term of copyright, provided conditions are met. Conveying is permitted under the terms below.

##### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights

No covered work is deemed part of an anti-circumvention measure under applicable laws. You waive any power to forbid circumvention of technological measures when conveying a covered work.

##### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code, provided you include appropriate copyright notices, keep all license notices intact, and provide a copy of this License.

##### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey modified versions under Section 4, provided you:

- State the modification and date.
- Release the work under this License.
- Ensure interactive interfaces display Appropriate Legal Notices.

##### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey object code if you also convey the Corresponding Source in specified ways, such as on a physical medium or via a network server at no charge.

##### 7. Additional Terms

You may add permissive terms to a covered work, but non-permissive terms are considered "further restrictions" and may be removed by recipients.

##### 8. Termination

Unauthorized propagation or modification terminates your rights under this License. Rights may be reinstated if violations are cured within specified periods.

##### 9. Acceptance Not Required

You are not required to accept this License to receive or run a copy, but modifying or propagating a covered work indicates acceptance.

##### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each recipient of a covered work automatically receives a license from the original licensors, subject to this License.

##### 11. Patents

Contributors grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license for their essential patent claims. Conveying a work knowingly relying on a patent license requires ensuring Corresponding Source availability.

##### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom

If conditions contradict this License, you may not convey the covered work.

##### 13. Remote Network Interaction

Modified versions used over a network must offer users access to the Corresponding Source at no charge.

##### 14. Revised Versions

The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of this License. You may choose any published version unless otherwise specified.

##### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Program is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, to the extent permitted by law.

##### 16. Limitation of Liability

No copyright holder or conveyor is liable for damages arising from the Program, unless required by law or agreed in writing.

##### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16

If the disclaimer or limitation of liability is unenforceable, courts shall apply local law approximating an absolute waiver of liability.
